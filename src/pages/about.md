I am a software developer born and raised in Switzerland, where I also live and work. Currently, I am employed at SUVA, one of Switzerland's largest insurance companies. My role involves helping customers deal with unexpected events and ensuring they receive the necessary support.

In my free time, I enjoy programming and have experience in various programming languages, including Elixir, Golang, NodeJS, and Python. I find coding to be a challenging and rewarding hobby, and I am always on the lookout for new projects and technologies to explore.

While I am far from being an expert in coding, I take pride in my ability to create innovative and efficient solutions to complex problems. I am passionate about programming and always eager to learn more and improve my skills.

Overall, I am a dedicated and enthusiastic software developer, constantly striving to improve my knowledge and skills. Whether it's at work or in my free time, I am always excited to tackle new challenges and create meaningful solutions.
