I was born in Switzerland and still live and work here. 
At the moment I work as an apprentice at SUVA, 
a national casualty insurance. There I develop web applications.
In my freetime I create software that helps people. 
Take the [**working hour calculator**](https://tc.enea.tech) I made,
 it can help people grasp how long they have to work.

Right now I am developing this website 
with Astro.js, and I have to say itâ€™s 
awesome ðŸ˜Ž. I have also used other 
Frameworks, such as Vue, React, Angular,
 Springboot, Express.js, Rocket, Django,
 Flask, Svelte and Phoenix.

**All of those interesting things can be found on my GitHub.**
