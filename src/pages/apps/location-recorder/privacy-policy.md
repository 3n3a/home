Thank you for using **Location Recorder**. Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains how we handle any data you may share while using our app. We do not collect or store any additional information beyond what is collected by Apple's systems and frameworks. This ensures that your personal data is handled with the utmost care and respect for your privacy.

## Data Collection

### Information Collected by Apple
When you use Location Recorder, the data collected is managed primarily by Apple. This includes:

- **Location Data**: The app tracks your location to provide location history functionality. All data handling related to your location is managed through Apple's Core Location services.
- **Device Information**: Apple may collect device-related information such as the device type and operating system version for service improvement.
- **Analytics**: Usage analytics may be collected by Apple to improve the performance and user experience of the app.

For more details on Apple's data collection policies, please refer to Apple's [Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/) and [App Store Privacy Guide](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/).

### No Additional Data Collection
